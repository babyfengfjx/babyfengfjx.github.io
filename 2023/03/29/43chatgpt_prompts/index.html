<h3 id="The-“Act-as…”-Hack"><a href="#The-“Act-as…”-Hack" class="headerlink" title="The “Act as…” Hack"></a>The “Act as…” Hack</h3><p>One of the <strong>most useful techniques for crafting effective ChatGPT prompts</strong> is the <strong>“act as”</strong> hack. This technique involves using the phrase “act as” in the prompt to tell the ChatGPT to assume a specific role or persona in the conversation. This can be especially useful for creating more engaging and immersive conversations, or for simulating real-world scenarios.</p>
<p>For example, you might use the “act as” hack to tell the ChatGPT to “act as a travel agent” and provide recommendations for vacation destinations based on the user’s preferences. Or you might tell the ChatGPT to “act as a detective” and solve a fictional crime. The possibilities are endless, and the “act as” hack can be a powerful tool for creating engaging and immersive ChatGPT conversations.</p>
<p>To use the “act as” hack, simply include the phrase “act as” followed by a description of the role or persona the ChatGPT should assume in the conversation. For example: “I want you to act as a travel agent. Can you recommend some vacation destinations based on my preferences?”</p>
<p>By using the “act as” hack, you can create more engaging and immersive ChatGPT conversations that are tailored to the specific interests and needs of the user.</p>
<p><strong>An Example:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want you to act as a javascript console. I will type commands and you will reply with what the javascript console should show. I want you to only reply with the terminal output inside one unique code block, and nothing else. do not write explanations. do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so. when i need to tell you something in english, i will do so by putting text inside curly brackets {like this}. my first command is console.log(“Hello World”);</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s dig into this example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>“I want you to act as a javascript console.”</strong> This sentence uses the “act as” hack to tell the ChatGPT to assume the role of a javascript console in the conversation.</li>
<li><strong>“I will type commands and you will reply with what the javascript console should show.”</strong> This sentence explains the user’s role in the conversation, and the ChatGPT’s role in responding to the commands typed by the user.</li>
<li><strong>“I want you to only reply with the terminal output inside one unique code block, and nothing else.”</strong> This sentence provides further instructions for the ChatGPT, specifying that it should only reply with the terminal output inside one unique code block, and not include any other content or explanations in its responses.</li>
<li><strong>“Do not write explanations.”</strong> This sentence is a repetition of the instruction from the previous sentence, emphasizing that the ChatGPT should not write any explanations in its responses.</li>
<li><strong>“Do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so.”</strong> This sentence provides further instructions for the ChatGPT, specifying that it should not type any commands unless instructed to do so by the user.</li>
<li><strong>“When I need to tell you something in english, I will do so by putting text inside curly brackets {like this}.”</strong> This sentence provides the user with instructions for how to communicate with the ChatGPT in English, by enclosing text in curly brackets.</li>
<li><strong>“My first command is console.log(“Hello World”);”</strong> This sentence provides the first command of the prompt, so ChatGPT will run first.</li>
